## Interview Concepts 101

Study with me. I covered important topics and interview questions that you might come across your future interviews.

Topics I've covered:
1. DSA(IN JAVA)
2. Java Concepts
3. Common mistakes I made while coding and how to overvome them.

I made it as simple as possible and included print statements for better understanding with custom print statements.
