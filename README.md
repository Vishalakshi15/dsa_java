## Interview Concepts 101

Study with me. I covered important topics and questions you might encounter in future interviews.

Topics I've covered:
1. DSA(IN JAVA)
2. Java Concepts
3. Common mistakes I made while coding and how to overcome them.

I made it as simple as possible and included print statements for better understanding with custom print statements.
