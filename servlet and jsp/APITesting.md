## Rest Assured Basics

Rest Assured is a popular Java library used for automating RESTful web services testing. It provides a domain-specific language (DSL) for writing tests for REST APIs in a simple and expressive manner. Rest Assured simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests, validating responses, and performing various assertions on the response data.
