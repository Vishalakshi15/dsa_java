Discussing the concept of dynamic web pages, web containers (like Tomcat), servlets, and deployment descriptors (web.xml) in the context of web development. Here's a summarized explanation:

1. **Dynamic Web Pages**: When a web page is dynamic, it means that its content is generated or built at the time of the request. The content of the page may vary depending on the parameters or data sent by the client.

2. **Web Container**: The web container is responsible for processing dynamic web page requests on the server-side. It can handle requests from clients and generate appropriate responses.

3. **Servlets**: A servlet is a Java class that extends `HTTPServlet`. It is used to handle requests and generate dynamic responses for web applications. When a client sends a request, the web container maps it to the appropriate servlet to process the request.

4. **Deployment Descriptor (web.xml)**: The deployment descriptor is an XML file (`web.xml`) used to configure the mapping of URLs to servlets. It helps the web container determine which servlet should be invoked to handle a particular request.

5. **Dynamic Page Generation**: When a client requests a dynamic web page that the server doesn't have pre-built (e.g., a specific page for a specific length), the request goes to a servlet. The servlet then generates the page's content based on the request parameters and business logic.

6. **Web Servers and Application Servers**: Web containers are often part of application servers. Tomcat is a popular web container and can also function as a standalone web server. Application servers, like JBoss or WebSphere, include additional features beyond web container functionality.

7. **XML and Annotations**: Traditionally, servlet-mapping was done using the `web.xml` file. However, in Servlet 3.0 and later versions, annotations can be used to define servlet mappings, avoiding the need for an XML file.

In summary, dynamic web pages are generated at the time of the request using servlets, which are Java classes that process client requests and generate dynamic responses. The web container, like Tomcat, manages the servlets and uses the deployment descriptor (web.xml or annotations) to map URLs to the appropriate servlets. This process enables the server to handle dynamic content and respond to client requests with dynamically generated pages.

Here's a simple summary:

# Dynamic Web Pages

are pages that are created on the spot when a user asks for them. They are not pre-made and change based on what the user needs.

# Web Containers
are like assistants for the server. They receive requests from users and help generate the right responses.

# Servlets
are special code files that the server uses to understand and process user requests. They create the dynamic content for the web pages.

# Deployment Descriptor (web.xml)
is a file that helps the server know which servlet to use for different requests.

# URL 
stands for "Uniform Resource Locator." 
It is a reference or an address used to access resources on the internet. URLs are used to identify and locate specific web pages, files, images, videos, and other resources hosted on web servers. They are essential for navigating the World Wide Web and are typically entered into a web browser's address bar to access a specific webpage or resource.
In a nutshell, when you ask for a dynamic web page, the server uses servlets and a web container to create the page just for you!
