## Solution




``` java
  class Solution {
    boolean hasValidSubset(int[] A, int target) {
        int n = A.length;
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[n + 1][target + 1];

        // Initializing the dp matrix
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= target; j++) {
                if (j == 0) {
                    // An empty subset can always have a sum of 0
                    dp[i][j] = true;
                } else if (i == 0) {
                    // An empty array cannot have a non-zero sum
                    dp[i][j] = false;
                } else {
    // Check if the current element can be included or excluded to achieve the target sum 'j'

    // Case 1: Exclude the current element
    // If we can achieve the target sum 'j' without including the current element,
    // then we can achieve the same target sum without the current element.
    boolean excludeCurrentElement = dp[i - 1][j];

    // Case 2: Include the current element
    // If the target sum 'j' is greater than or equal to the current element, and
    // we can achieve the remaining sum (j - A[i - 1]) without the current element,
    // then we can achieve the target sum 'j' by including the current element.
    boolean includeCurrentElement = j >= A[i - 1] && dp[i - 1][j - A[i - 1]];

    // Combine both cases: If either of the cases is true, then we can achieve the target sum 'j'
    dp[i][j] = excludeCurrentElement || includeCurrentElement;
}

            }
        }

        // The final cell of the matrix represents whether there exists a subset with the target sum
        return dp[n][target];
    }
}

  

```

Your code looks good, and the print statements help visualize the dynamic programming matrix during the computation. Let's analyze the output:

```
Entering i= 0
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
Entering i= 1
1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
Entering i= 2
1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
Entering i= 3
1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 
Entering i= 4
1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 
Entering i= 5
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 
```

Here's the breakdown:

- `Entering i= 0`: Represents the initial state where there are no elements in the array (`A` is empty). An empty subset can always have a sum of 0 (`dp[0][j]` for all `j`).
  
- `Entering i= 1`: Represents the state after considering the first element of the array (`A[0] = 1`). The matrix is updated based on whether a subset with a sum of each `j` can be achieved with this element or not.

- `Entering i= 2`: Represents the state after considering the first two elements of the array (`A[0] = 1` and `A[1] = 3`). The matrix is updated accordingly.

- `Entering i= 3`: Represents the state after considering the first three elements of the array (`A[0] = 1`, `A[1] = 3`, and `A[2] = 4`). The matrix is updated based on the inclusion or exclusion of each element.

- `Entering i= 4`: Represents the state after considering the first four elements of the array (`A[0] = 1`, `A[1] = 3`, `A[2] = 4`, and `A[3] = 9`). The matrix is updated accordingly.

- `Entering i= 5`: Represents the final state after considering all elements of the array (`A[0] = 1`, `A[1] = 3`, `A[2] = 4`, `A[3] = 9`, and `A[4] = 2`). The matrix is updated based on the inclusion or exclusion of each element.

The final result is obtained from `dp[5][13]`, indicating whether there exists a subset with the target sum (in this case, 13). In this example, the result is `true` because there exists a subset [1, 3, 9] with a sum equal to the target (13).


``` java
  public class MyClass {
    static boolean  hasValidSubset(int[] A, int target) {
        int n = A.length;
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[n + 1][target + 1];

        // Initializing the dp matrix
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            System.out.println("Entering i= "+i);
            for (int j = 0; j <= target; j++) {
                
                
                if (j == 0) {
                    // An empty subset can always have a sum of 0
                    dp[i][j] = true;
                } else if (i == 0) {
                    // An empty array cannot have a non-zero sum
                    dp[i][j] = false;
                } else {
                    // Check if the current element can be included or excluded
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] || (j >= A[i - 1] && dp[i - 1][j - A[i - 1]]);
                }

                // Print the dp matrix after each iteration
                System.out.print(dp[i][j] ? "1 " : "0 ");
            }
            System.out.println();  // Move to the next line after each row
        }

        // The final cell of the matrix represents whether there exists a subset with the target sum
        return dp[n][target];
    }
    
    public static void main (String args[]){
        
        int[] A = {1, 3, 4, 9, 2};
int target = 13;
hasValidSubset(A, target);
    }
}

```
