## Solution

### Why  Middle method ?

In the provided code, the division of functionality into three methods (`sudokuSolver`, `solveSudoku`, and `dfs`) serves to improve code readability, modularity, and separation of concerns. Let's discuss the roles of each method:

1. **`sudokuSolver` Method:**
   - This method serves as the entry point for solving the Sudoku puzzle.
   - It takes the initial Sudoku board (`sudoku`) as an input parameter and calls the `solveSudoku` method to start the solving process.
   - By having a high-level method like this, the main goal of solving the Sudoku puzzle is clear and encapsulated.



2. **`solveSudoku` Method:**
   - This method is responsible for initializing the solving process by calling the `dfs` method with the initial state of the Sudoku board and the starting position (0).
   - It acts as a bridge between the high-level `sudokuSolver` method and the low-level `dfs` method, encapsulating the details of the solving algorithm.


3. **`dfs` Method:**
   - This method implements the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm for solving the Sudoku puzzle.
   - It recursively explores different possibilities by trying to fill each cell with numbers ('1' to '9') and backtracking when necessary.
   - The boolean return type indicates whether a valid solution is found (`true`) or not (`false`).
   - Separating the DFS logic into its own method allows for better organization and makes the code more modular.

```java
private boolean dfs(char[][] board, int s) {
    if (s == 81)
        return true;
    // ... (rest of the DFS logic)
}
```

By breaking down the solving process into these methods, each method has a clear responsibility, making the code easier to understand, maintain, and modify. It adheres to the principle of separation of concerns, where each method focuses on a specific aspect of the overall task. This structure also facilitates testing and debugging of individual components.












### dfs 

This part of the code is crucial for the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm used to solve the Sudoku puzzle. Let's break it down:


1. **Checking if the Puzzle is Solved (`if (s == 81) return true;`):**
   - If `s` reaches 81, it means all cells in the Sudoku board have been filled, and the puzzle is solved. In this case, the method returns `true`, indicating a successful solution.

2. **Calculating Row and Column Indices (`final int i = s / 9; final int j = s % 9;`):**
   - `i` and `j` are calculated based on the current position `s` in the Sudoku board. `i` represents the row index, and `j` represents the column index.

3. **Checking if the Current Cell is Filled (`if (board[i][j] != '.') return dfs(board, s + 1);`):**
   - If the current cell at position (`i`, `j`) is already filled (not equal to '.'), it means it has a predefined value in the original puzzle. In this case, the algorithm moves to the next cell by calling `dfs(board, s + 1)` recursively.

4. **Trying Different Numbers (`for (char c = '1'; c <= '9'; ++c) ...`):**
   - If the current cell is empty, the algorithm enters a loop to try placing numbers ('1' to '9') in the cell.
   - It checks the validity of placing each number using the `isValid` method.
   - If placing a number is valid, it updates the board, calls `dfs` recursively for the next cell (`s + 1`), and checks if it leads to a successful solution (`if (dfs(board, s + 1)) return true;`).
   - If a valid placement is found, the method returns `true`, indicating a successful solution for the current cell.
   - If no valid number is found for the current cell, it backtracks by resetting the cell to an empty state (`board[i][j] = '.'`) and continues the loop.

5. **Returning `false` if No Valid Number is Found:**
   - If the loop exhausts all possibilities and no valid number is found for the current cell, the method returns `false`. This triggers backtracking to the previous cell in the recursive stack.

This combination of recursion, backtracking, and checking for a completed puzzle makes the algorithm explore different possibilities until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

### Is valid?

This code is part of the `isValid` method, which checks whether it's valid to place a given character `c` at a specific position (`row`, `col`) on the Sudoku board. Let's break down the logic:


1. **Checking Rows (`board[i][col] == c`):**
   - `board[i][col] == c` checks if the character `c` is already present in the same column (`col`) for any row (`i`). If it is, the placement is not valid, and `false` is returned.

2. **Checking Columns (`board[row][i] == c`):**
   - `board[row][i] == c` checks if the character `c` is already present in the same row (`row`) for any column (`i`). If it is, the placement is not valid, and `false` is returned.

3. **Checking 3x3 Subgrids (`board[3 * (row / 3) + i / 3][3 * (col / 3) + i % 3] == c`):**
   - This part checks if the character `c` is already present in the 3x3 subgrid containing the cell at position (`row`, `col`).
   - `3 * (row / 3) + i / 3` calculates the starting row index of the current 3x3 subgrid.
   - `3 * (col / 3) + i % 3` calculates the starting column index of the current 3x3 subgrid.
   - This effectively checks if the character `c` is already present in the 3x3 subgrid covering the current cell (`row`, `col`).
   - If `c` is found in the subgrid, the placement is not valid, and `false` is returned.

If none of the above conditions is met for any `i` (from 0 to 8), it means the placement of `c` in the current position (`row`, `col`) is valid, and `true` is returned.
