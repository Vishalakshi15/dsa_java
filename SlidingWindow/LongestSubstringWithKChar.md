## Solution


1. **Problem Statement**: The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring in the given string 's' such that each character in that substring appears at least 'k' times.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**: We will use a sliding window approach to efficiently explore different substrings within the given string.

3. **Character Frequency Tracking**: Initialize an array `charCount` to keep track of the frequency of each character in the string. Since the input only consists of lowercase English letters, we can use an array of size 26 (one for each letter).

4. **Iterate Over Unique Characters**: We will iterate over the number of unique characters in the string, ranging from 1 to 26 (the total number of lowercase English letters). This is because if there are more than 26 unique characters, we cannot form a valid substring with each character occurring at least 'k' times.

5. **Sliding Window Setup**: Within each iteration, we maintain two pointers: `start` and `end` to represent the current window. Initialize `start` and `end` to 0.

6. **Counters Initialization**: Initialize `uniqueCount` to 0 (to count the number of unique characters in the current window) and `countAtLeastK` to 0 (to count characters occurring at least 'k' times in the current window).

7. **Sliding Window Expansion and Contraction**: While `end` is less than the length of the string, do the following:
   - If `uniqueCount` is less than or equal to the current number of unique characters (indicating that we can expand the window), process the character at the `end` index.
   - If `uniqueCount` becomes equal to the number of unique characters, and all characters in the window occur at least 'k' times, update `maxLen` with the length of the current valid substring.

   - If `uniqueCount` exceeds the number of unique characters, we need to contract the window. Process the character at the `start` index.

8. **Update Counters**: As we expand and contract the window, update `uniqueCount` and `countAtLeastK` accordingly based on character frequencies.

9. **Max Length Update**: After processing each window, update `maxLen` with the maximum length found so far.

10. **Repeat for All Unique Characters**: Repeat the above steps for all possible numbers of unique characters in the string.

11. **Result**: After all iterations, `maxLen` will hold the length of the longest valid substring.

12. **Return Maximum Length**: Return `maxLen` as the final result.

``` java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubstring(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] charCount = new int[26]; // Assuming lowercase English letters
        
        int maxLen = 0;
        
        for (int uniqueChars = 1; uniqueChars <= 26; uniqueChars++) {
            Arrays.fill(charCount, 0);
            int start = 0, end = 0, countAtLeastK = 0, uniqueCount = 0;
            
            while (end < n) {
                if (uniqueCount <= uniqueChars) {
                    int index = s.charAt(end) - 'a';
                    if (charCount[index] == 0) {
                        uniqueCount++;
                    }
                    charCount[index]++;
                    if (charCount[index] == k) {
                        countAtLeastK++;
                    }
                    end++;
                } else {
                    int index = s.charAt(start) - 'a';
                    if (charCount[index] == k) {
                        countAtLeastK--;
                    }
                    charCount[index]--;
                    if (charCount[index] == 0) {
                        uniqueCount--;
                    }
                    start++;
                }
                
                if (uniqueCount == uniqueChars && uniqueCount == countAtLeastK) {
                    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, end - start);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
}

```

## Another Approach

It utilizes a recursive divide-and-conquer approach. Here's a thought process explaining why it's not a sliding window solution:

1. **Problem Statement**: The problem asks us to find the length of the longest substring in a given string 's' such that each character in that substring appears at least 'k' times.

2. **Recursive Divide-and-Conquer Approach**: The solution employs a recursive strategy to solve this problem. It does not use a fixed-size window that slides through the string. Instead, it recursively examines different parts of the string and splits it into smaller substrings when necessary.

3. **Character Counting**: The solution begins by counting the frequency of each character in the substring under consideration. This character counting step is not a characteristic of sliding window algorithms.

4. **Divide and Conquer**: If the character count for any character is less than 'k', the solution splits the substring into smaller parts at that character, effectively dividing and conquering the problem.

5. **Recursion**: The split substrings are then recursively processed, attempting to find the longest valid substrings within them.

6. **Base Case**: The recursion stops when a substring's length is less than 'k' because such substrings cannot satisfy the condition.

In summary, this solution uses a recursive divide-and-conquer strategy, which is different from the sliding window technique. It recursively explores different parts of the string and checks the character frequencies, making it a fundamentally distinct approach for solving this particular problem.

``` java
class Solution {
    public int longestSubstring(String s, int k) {
        return longestSubstringHelper(s, k, 0, s.length() - 1);
    }
    
    private int longestSubstringHelper(String s, int k, int start, int end) {
        if (end - start + 1 < k) {
            // If the substring length is less than k, it can't satisfy the condition.
            return 0;
        }
        
        int[] charCount = new int[26]; // Assuming lowercase English letters
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            charCount[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (charCount[i] > 0 && charCount[i] < k) {
                // Find a character that occurs less than k times in the substring.
                // Split the string at this character and recursively check both sides.
                char splitChar = (char) ('a' + i);
                int splitIndex = s.indexOf(splitChar, start);
                int left = longestSubstringHelper(s, k, start, splitIndex - 1);
                int right = longestSubstringHelper(s, k, splitIndex + 1, end);
                return Math.max(left, right);
            }
        }
        
        // If all characters in the substring occur at least k times, return its length.
        return end - start + 1;
    }
}

```
