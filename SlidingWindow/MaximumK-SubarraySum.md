## Solution

**Problem Statement**: You are given an array and a number `k`, and you need to find the sum of the subarray of size `k` that has the maximum sum among all possible subarrays of size `k`.

**Thought Process**:

1. We have an array and we need to find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`. To do this, we can use a sliding window approach.

2. First, initialize two variables: `max_sum` and `current_sum` to keep track of the maximum sum found so far and the sum of the current subarray, respectively.

3. Start by calculating the sum of the first `k` elements of the array and assign it to both `max_sum` and `current_sum` since this is our initial window.

4. Now, iterate through the array from index `k` to the end. At each step, do the following:
   - Add the current element to `current_sum`.
   - Subtract the element that is no longer part of the current window (i.e., the element at index `i - k`) from `current_sum`. This ensures that our window remains of size `k`.
   - Update `max_sum` by taking the maximum of `max_sum` and `current_sum`.

5. Continue this process until you have iterated through the entire array. At each step, you are effectively sliding the window of size `k` one element to the right and updating the sums.

6. After the loop ends, `max_sum` will hold the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k` in the array.

7. Return `max_sum` as the result.

In summary, the sliding window technique involves maintaining a "window" of a fixed size (`k` in this case) and efficiently updating the sum of the elements within that window as you slide it through the array. This allows you to find the maximum sum subarray of the specified size without the need for nested loops or inefficient brute-force methods.

``` java
class Solution {
    int maxKSubarraySum(int[] A, int k) {
        int n = A.length;
        if (k > n) {
            return -1;  // Invalid input, k should not be greater than n
        }

        int maxSum = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            currentSum += A[i];
        }

        maxSum = currentSum;

        for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            currentSum = currentSum + A[i] - A[i - k];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
        }

        return maxSum;
    }
}

```
