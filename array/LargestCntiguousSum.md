## Solution


The idea is to iterate through the array and maintain a running sum of the contiguous subarray. 

```java
class Solution {
    int largestContiguousSum(int[] arr) {
        if (arr == null || arr.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int currentSum = arr[0];
        int maxSum = arr[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            // Compare whether it's better to start a new subarray or extend the existing one
            currentSum = Math.max(arr[i], currentSum + arr[i]);
            
            // Update the maximum sum
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
        }

        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

Explanation of changes:

1. Introduced `currentSum` to keep track of the sum of the current contiguous subarray.

2. For each element in the array, update `currentSum` to either continue the current subarray or start a new one. The idea is to consider whether it's better to extend the existing subarray or start a new one from the current element.

3. Update `maxSum` whenever a new maximum sum is found.

4. The final result is the maximum sum found during the iterations.

This should give you the correct result for the largest contiguous sum.
