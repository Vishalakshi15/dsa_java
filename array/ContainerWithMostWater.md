## Solution

In a greedy approach, you make the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping that it leads to a globally optimal solution. In this problem, the choice is to move the pointers towards each other based on the minimum height between them, maximizing the potential area.


In a greedy approach, the strategy is to make the best possible decision at each step without considering the consequences of the decision on future steps. The hope is that by consistently making locally optimal choices, the algorithm will converge to a globally optimal solution. 


1. **Start with the widest container:**
   - The algorithm starts with the widest possible container, which is formed by considering the leftmost and rightmost elements of the array.
   - The two pointers, `l` and `r`, initially point to the leftmost and rightmost elements, respectively.

2. **Choose the minimum height:**
   - At each step, the algorithm calculates the potential area of the container formed by the current pointers (`l` and `r`).
   - The height of the container is determined by the minimum height between the walls at `height[l]` and `height[r]`.
   - The width of the container is the difference between the indices of `l` and `r`.

3. **Update the maximum area:**
   - The algorithm maintains a variable `max` to keep track of the maximum area encountered so far.
   - If the calculated area is greater than the current `max`, update `max` with the new area.

4. **Move pointers towards each other:**
   - To explore other potential containers with greater areas, the algorithm moves the pointers towards each other.
   - The pointer with the smaller height (`l` or `r`) is moved inward, hoping to find a taller wall and increase the potential area.

5. **Repeat until pointers meet:**
   - Steps 2-4 are repeated until the pointers `l` and `r` meet or cross each other.
   - The algorithm explores various combinations of walls and calculates the potential areas for each, updating the maximum area as it goes.

By consistently choosing the locally optimal option (moving towards a higher wall), the algorithm explores different container configurations and converges to a solution with the maximum area.

This approach is greedy because, at each step, it makes a choice based solely on the local information (heights of walls at current positions), hoping that these local optimal choices lead to the best overall solution.


''' java 

    class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
        int maxArea = 0;

        while (left < right) {
            int currentArea = Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left);
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, currentArea);

            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }

        return maxArea;
    }
    }
